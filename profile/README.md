  We are the creators of the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/helldivers-companion/api">Helldivers Companion API</a> and the Helldivers Companion App  (cooming soon). We are open source to give back to the amazing Helldivers 2 community.

## Philosophy

We believe that the community should have free access to all game data on the fly instead of paying for a ad-free experience. Not sharing your code while posing as "community-driven" is also a no-no. Looking at you <a href="helldivers.io" target="_blank">helldivers.io</a>. 

## Motivation

Helldivers 2 is a blast and not only offers some of the best gameplay we have seen in years but also the urge to interact with the game world when not in front of your PS5 or PC. This is why we created the Helldivers Companion API: To give everyone including us a change to interact with the games data source.

## Contributing

Everyone is welcome to contribute, we strive to build a community that not only is technically skilled but in the near future also some writters when we will add a lore wiki to the API. 

### Special Thanks

Many thanks go out to [dealloc](https://github.com/dealloc), as we have taken some inspiration, as well as the planetary source data that was contained in the [helldivers2-api](https://github.com/dealloc/helldivers2-api) repository written by them in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). If you ever come around this repository, feel free to access our revamped sector data!
