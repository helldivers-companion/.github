<p align="center">
  We are the creators of the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hellhub-collective/api">HellHub API</a>. We believe in open source to give back to the amazing Helldivers 2 community.
</p>

## Philosophy

We believe that the community should have free access to all game data on the fly instead of paying for a ad-free experience. Not sharing your code while posing as "community-driven" is also a no-no. Looking at you <a href="helldivers.io" target="_blank">helldivers.io</a>. 

## Motivation

Helldivers 2 is a blast and not only offers some of the best gameplay we have seen in years but also the urge to interact with the game world when not in front of your PS5 or PC. This is why we created the HellHub API: To give everyone including us a easy way to interact with the games data source.

## Our projects

We have long surpassed the initial goal of only providing a easy-to-use API and have update our API based on user feedback and created some additional projects for everybody. Of course these projects are also open source and free to use!

- [**SDK**](https://github.com/hellhub-collective/sdk): A completely type safe and autocomplete ready SDK to access all data within our API. We even built a integrated query builder that can create complex queries with ease!

- [**CLI**](https://github.com/hellhub-collective/cli): Built on top of our API and leveraging the capabilities of our SDK: A command line interface for Helldivers 2: View the war progress without leaving your terminal!

- [**API**](https://github.com/hellhub-collective/api): Effortlessly use Helldivers 2 data in your apps. Our data updates **every minute**. No registration, authorization or bearer tokens. Democratically approved!

## Contributing

Everyone is welcome to contribute, we strive to build a community that not only is technically skilled but in the near future also some writters when we will add a lore wiki to the API. 

### Special Thanks

Many thanks go out to [dealloc](https://github.com/dealloc), as we have taken some inspiration, as well as the planetary source data that was contained in the [helldivers2-api](https://github.com/dealloc/helldivers2-api) repository written by them in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). If you ever come around this repository, feel free to access our revamped sector data!
